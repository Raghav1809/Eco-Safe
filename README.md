# ♻️ Informal Handling of E-Waste Causing Health Hazards

## 📌 Project Overview

Improper and informal handling of electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing environmental and public health concern. Many discarded electronic items are processed through unsafe recycling practices, exposing workers and communities to toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium.

This project provides a **digital platform** that connects users with authorized recycling centers, ensures safe disposal, and promotes awareness about responsible e-waste management.
